# Project Labyrinth - Zelda Game üó°Ô∏è

This project was about building an app fetching from an API using react-redux and thunks to wrap the API calls. The game is started by sending the given username by POST method as JSON and continued by sending and fetching more data to update the current's position. We started working with pair-programming and then we created differents branches for each new features.

## The problem

We started by deciding the theme and what components we would need, then started building the reducers and fetching-data. We continued by building the Game and StartPage component to display the fetch. We had some problems with the second fetch and spent some time trying to figure out how to send the coordinates. If we had more time we would have continued to explore the usage of reusable components.

Technologies: APIs, Postman, React, Redux, Styled Components, Thunks.
